# Task Intake Guidance

## Creation and Confirmation

Provide guidance only for new bug or feature requests that have not yet chosen an execution mode. Tasks continued via `start`, `resume`, or `notify`, and existing cards named by the user, continue on the original card; do not ask again or create another card. When the user has already explicitly chosen the kanban board or direct execution, follow the chosen flow without asking again. Pure Q&A, read-only investigation, minor documentation or configuration tweaks, releases, and merges do not trigger intake guidance.

When `rules.task_groups=true` and `rules.git=true`, read `KANDER-TASK-GROUP-RULES.md` "Task Splitting and Task Groups" before presenting the options, and state in the plan whether the work is one card or a task group. For a group, also list the member card titles, their dependency order, and the step that merges each group branch back into `develop` in dependency order once its gates pass. Card bodies are written after confirmation; the split and the merge-back step are confirmed together with the plan. When task groups are disabled, plan a single card and do not load the disabled module.

After finishing the analysis and implementation plan, present the options once:

```text
- Confirm the plan and use the kanban board (create the cards and start)
- Confirm the plan and use the kanban board (create the cards, do not start yet)
- Confirm the plan, skip the board, do it in this session
- Adjust the plan
```

Number these options from `1` and make them the only numbered question in that message, so the numbers cannot collide with another question.

- Choosing `Confirm the plan and use the kanban board (create the cards and start)` authorizes the plan, the development, and the kanban flow at once, including the merge-back steps the plan states; do not ask again before starting work or before integrating. This covers a standalone card and every task group named in the confirmed plan.

  For a standalone card with `rules.git=true`, this execution authorization also covers integration into `develop` and cleanup, with the conditions stated in `KANDER-GIT-RULES.md` "Commit and Push"; do not request a separate merge-back confirmation. The completion flow is defined in `KANDER-KANBAN-RULES.md` "Execution and Completion".

  For a single card, run in order: `kander new`, fill in the complete contract according to the confirmed plan, complete the self-review and any applicable independent card review per `KANDER-KANBAN-RULES.md` "Post-Creation Self-Review" and fix the findings, `kander pick <task-id>` (defined in `KANDER-KANBAN-RULES.md` "Command Contract"), `kander start <task-id>`. Start and tracking responsibilities follow `KANDER-KANBAN-RULES.md` "Claiming, Starting, and Coordination"; the discussing agent no longer implements a card that has been delegated.

  For a task group, create every member card the same way, complete the group-level checks in `KANDER-TASK-GROUP-RULES.md` "Task Splitting and Task Groups", then orchestrate per that file. The confirmed plan is the orchestration plan; it already carries the integration authorization for each group it names.

- Choosing `Confirm the plan and use the kanban board (create the cards, do not start yet)` authorizes the plan and card creation only. Create the cards, complete the self-review and applicable independent card review, and leave them in `backlog/`; do not move them to `todo/` or start them. Starting later requires a further user instruction; that instruction enters the same flow as the first option from `kander pick` onward (after `pick`, `kander move <task-id> working --owner <agent>` replaces `kander start` only when the user explicitly asks this agent to execute the card itself, per `KANDER-KANBAN-RULES.md` "Claiming, Starting, and Coordination"), and it carries the integration authorization of the confirmed plan; do not ask for it again.
- Choosing `Confirm the plan, skip the board, do it in this session` implements directly per the project rules, without creating a card.
- Choosing `Adjust the plan` modifies the plan; no card is created or started yet.
