# Repository Guidelines

This file is the development contract for the Kander repository itself. The workflow rules the repository ships live in `rules/`; those files are deliverables, not a description of this repository's package boundaries.

## Repository-Specific Exceptions

- In this repository the second-stage security roles `CSA` and `Hacker` are always marked N/A and never run; `PM` and `QA` remain applicable.
- When every change since the review base is Markdown rules or documentation, skip the review. As soon as any script, code, or other non-Markdown file is included, run `PM` and `QA` per the applicable rules; `CSA` and `Hacker` stay N/A per the previous bullet.

## Language Conventions

- Commit messages are English only: title, body, and trailers all in English, with no Chinese left. History is already unified to English; later commits must not regress.
- Code comments are English only: line, block, and doc comments in `.go`, plus comments in `.sh` / `.ps1` and other scripts.
- The released rules ship as two copies: the English originals in `rules/en/` and the Chinese translation in `rules/cn/`, file for file. Change both together and keep them saying the same thing; every protocol token inside backticks (commands, config keys, field names, status values) must be byte-identical between them, and only the narrative prose is translated. The installer extracts the copy the configured `language` selects (`cn` Chinese, everything else English). The language the agent uses with the user is still the `agent_language` setting, which the "Language" section of the rules entry `KANDER-AGENTS.md` tells the agent to honor; keep that section in place when the rules change.
- Repository documentation (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/`) is written in English. The README defaults to the English `README.md`, with the Chinese and Japanese translations in `README-CN.md` and `README-JA.md`; keep the three versions in sync. User-facing strings still go through the `internal/i18n` message catalog and are not rewritten because of this bullet.

## Go Module and Package Map

- Module path: `github.com/dualface/kander`.
- Single binary entry point: `cmd/kander`. `main.go` only calls `internal/cli.Run`; the other files in that directory wire in implementation packages via blank imports, triggering each package's `init` bindings. Do not add a second command entry point.
- Running `kander` without a subcommand opens the terminal kanban directly: `internal/cli` exposes `DefaultRunner`, set by `internal/tui` at registration time; `internal/cli` does not depend back on `internal/tui`.
- `internal/cli` centrally maintains the command-name and Runner registry. `doctor`/`config`/`version` and the board commands are wired in this package; launch/liveness/notify/review/takeover override their Runners from the implementation packages. `check` is first wired to the board structural check, and the full binary lets liveness override it with structural check plus the liveness section. The storage commands of `dispatch` are first wired to board, and the full binary lets launch add the Git integration evidence and exit-fact verification entry.
- Package responsibilities:

| Package             | Responsibility                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `internal/cli`      | Command-name and Runner registry, global `--lang`, argument parsing and dispatch |
| `internal/config`   | Install scopes, optional project `.kander-config.json` overlay merge, `config.json` schema/repair, read access for language/agent language/launcher/agents/models/rules/TUI |
| `internal/version`  | Unified version number built from the build timestamp and Git hash    |
| `internal/i18n`     | go-i18n message catalogs and template rendering; does not depend on config, the language is passed in by the caller |
| `internal/fs`       | POSIX no-follow and Windows handle/reparse/DACL/shared and exclusive locks |
| `internal/process`  | Agent CLI resolution, UTF-8 task files, argv/env invocation construction |
| `internal/board`    | Board location, revision/CAS/multi-file transaction recovery, journal pending/committed partitions and retention cleanup, controlled updates and lifecycle commands, review run/batch identity, originals, per-card publication indexes and integrity checks, dispatch intents, review-original bindings, epochs, wrap-up-only grants and atomic receipts, start attempts and success/rollback originals |
| `internal/launch`   | start/resume, structured Start/PreviewStart entry points reused by CLI/TUI, takeover launches, liveness confirmation and version-based failure rollback; orchestration Git reconciliation one-way reuses review, dispatch's Git integration and exit-fact verification |
| `internal/focus`    | Read-only consumption of card WINDOW, reusing probe to detect and switch herdr/tmux focus; called asynchronously by the TUI |
| `internal/probe`    | herdr/tmux pane fact collection                                       |
| `internal/liveness` | check's liveness section, session reverse lookup, and the subscribe JSON Lines event stream |
| `internal/notify`   | notify direct delivery, busy/expiry decisions, resume recovery and revision-conflict handling |
| `internal/takeover` | dismiss, and old-container cleanup after a successful resume takeover |
| `internal/window`   | Card `WINDOW` write-back; reuses board transactions, stale rollback preserves newer records |
| `internal/review`   | The single review gate of `kander review` and closed-batch historical Git verification |
| `internal/flow`     | Read-only consumption of the options-session configuration, producing structured agent/model listings for execution and review stages; does not depend on TUI or menu |
| `internal/tui`      | The terminal kanban for bare `kander` and the Huh options panel       |
| `internal/menu`     | doctor/config, environment probing and repair, `menu.Session` shared with the options panel |
| `internal/install`  | First-run wizard, `kander install`, rules extraction and doctor repair |
| `internal/testfakes` | Imported from `_test` files only: writes and warms the fake commands tests put on PATH, avoiding macOS first-execution latency |

- Card creation is unified as `<task-id>/spec.md`; SIZE decides small/large semantics. `Entry.Kind`/`TaskSummary.kind` in public snapshots express the size (the in-package structural scan leaves Kind empty; attachSize fills it in), and physical form uses `Entry.IsDirectory()`. File cards are read-only compatible; init migrates them through the existing transactions inside an explicit maintenance window. Never derive completion gates or models from the directory form.
- The runtime board data directory is still `kanban/` in the main worktree, and the override is still `KANBAN_DIR`. The config keys `kanban_agent` / `kanban_agents` / `models.kanban` keep the schema from the onevoke era (Kander's former name) and are not renamed.
- `rules` stores the seven optional module switches collaboration/code/git/review/task_intake/task_groups/reporting. New configs default to all on; a valid old config missing the whole rules section keeps all seven on, while missing keys inside the section are off. Parsing and doctor repair reuse internal/config, and the switches are independent of the `welcome_complete` initialization state. task_groups depends on git; the TUI options panel reuses `menu.Session.SetRules`, and start/resume/takeover/notify re-check the task-group dependency before side effects. Card task-group parsing reuses `board.TaskGroupFrom`, including the legacy discussion-section fields.
- `language` only decides kander's own interface and command output language, with values `cn`/`en`/`ja`. `agent_language` is the language the agent uses with the user, a free-form string (such as `en`, `zh-CN`, `ja`) that must be non-empty, single-line, and at most 64 characters; when the key is missing it is derived from `language` (cn gives `zh-CN`, en gives `en`, ja gives `ja`), and doctor repair derives it the same way. The options panel offers a fixed candidate list, while the schema still accepts hand-edited values outside the list. `kander new` writes the then-current `agent_language` (or the explicit `--language` value, same validation) into the card's `LANGUAGE` field; the card's language is frozen from then on and takes precedence over the configuration. Old cards missing the field fall back to the configuration, and `kander check` does not validate it. The task files written by `kander start` / `resume` / `notify` (direct delivery and recovery) carry a fixed English language instruction whose value matches the card `LANGUAGE` (or the configuration when the field is missing). The installer no longer extracts rules per language, and `kander-rules-state.json` no longer records a language. The installer extracts the rules `rules.LangFor(language)` selects (`cn` Chinese, `en`/`ja` English), `kander-rules-state.json` records the extracted language, and an older state file without that key is read as English; doctor reports drift between the configured language and the installed rules, and repair rewrites only the files that still match their stamp before switching the language.
- `integrate_agent_rules` decides whether install and doctor write the rules entry reference into each execution agent's own rules file (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and friends); it defaults to on, an older config without the key counts as on, and doctor repair preserves an explicit `false`. With it off, doctor only reports the entry path instead of touching those files, and rules extraction itself is unaffected.
- `review_stages.<large|small>.<role>` stores `auto` / `skip` / `required` for the four review roles per task scale; a missing section, scale, or role defaults to `auto`. A legacy flat `{role: mode}` object still loads and applies to both scales; saves rewrite it as the two-scale form. The role exceptions at the top of this file take precedence over this configuration. When a task-group batch mixes sizes, use the `large` scale.
- Models in `models.kanban.<agent>` are stored per task size in `large_model` / `small_model`. The reasoning efforts for codex/claude/grok live in `large_effort` / `small_effort`, and the old shared key `model` is still accepted: an empty size model falls back to it. Cursor and Kimi accept only the two size model keys, with no shared `model` or reasoning effort: their CLIs have no reasoning-effort switch. The options panel edits the size keys only.
- `models.review_roles.<role>` stores the role's own `model` / `effort` overrides. Defaults and valid old configs may be empty; empty entries fall back at runtime via `config.ReviewModelFor(cfg, agent, role)` to the `models.review.<agent>` value of the agent given by the caller. Only when entering the "Review and models" section of the options panel does `menu.Session` try to fill missing entries from the current Reviewer's values; when the Reviewer's source value is empty or absent, the empty value is kept. `kander review` can specify a reviewer explicitly, which is not necessarily the role's configured Reviewer.

## TUI Stack

The terminal interface uses the Charm libraries as one set, with no hand-rolled terminal backend:

| Library    | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bubble Tea | Runtime: alt-screen, input, mouse, resize, `tea.Exec` terminal suspension |
| Lip Gloss  | Styling and layout: columns composed with `JoinHorizontal`, popup borders, theme colors |
| Bubbles    | `viewport` (detail and report scrolling), `spinner` (environment probing) |
| Huh        | All options-panel forms: the root menu and each section      |
| Glamour    | Markdown rendering of card bodies                           |

- The geometry of the board and detail views (column X/width, card rows) is computed by this package itself; mouse hit testing and drag-select copying depend on it. Do not hand layout over to a component library.
- Selections and cursors are always computed on plain text with ANSI stripped (`ansi.Strip`), then recolored by span at render time.
- Popups are composited onto the underlying frame by display column via `overlay()`, not by full-screen replacement.
- The board view launches backlog/todo cards after `s` confirmation; the TUI calls `internal/launch`'s structured entry points one way and reuses board's controlled migration. Background launches and warnings flow back through pendingWork rather than writing stdout/stderr directly; foreground/console only prompt to use the CLI. Pressing `s` pops the dialog immediately and previews only the target card through pendingWork, discarding stale results by task ID and request sequence; while loading, the wheel keeps operating the board and changing the selection closes the old dialog. After confirmation the launching state is kept, and on completion the dialog shows success/failure and warnings; the result body keeps full content in a viewport with wheel scrolling, and any key closes the terminal state. Narrow screens compress the result footer, and when necessary a temporary overlay that does not capture input shows the full result.
- `internal/menu` must not import `internal/tui`; the TUI options panel reuses the `menu.Session` configuration logic one way.

## Subcommands

The Runner registry contains: `doctor` `config` `version` `install` `review` `init` `list`/`ls` `show` `update` `new` `move` `pick` `start` `resume` `notify` `dismiss` `check` `guard-write` `dispatch` `coordinator` `subscribe`. `help` is a special branch that prints the top-level help directly and does not enter the Runner registry. Bare `kander` opens the terminal kanban; the global flag is `--lang {cn,en,ja}`.

## TUI Tests

- The test cases for `internal/tui` stay in the package and cover stable rendering constraints and interactions: light/dark canvas backgrounds, screen filling, visible columns and focus, Markdown conversion, ANSI-stripped content, preference read/write, keys and mouse, the options panel, and a PTY launch smoke test.
- Do not build full-screen snapshots of frequently changing borders, logos, or status-bar text. Full visual results are still checked in a real terminal.

## Test Commands

Shared by POSIX and Windows (Windows-specific tests skip on non-Windows):

```sh
go test ./...
```

For a single package:

```sh
go test ./internal/fs
go test ./internal/config
```

The repository has no Python yet. Run `go test ./...` at the module root before committing; no coverage threshold is set currently. Tests must isolate themselves in temporary directories and never rewrite the user's real board or `$HOME` configuration.

## Windows Handles / Reparse / DACL

Go runtime writes of configuration, board migration, the review runtime, Git exclude, and the binaries and rules extracted by the installer go through `internal/fs`.

- Reject symlinks, junctions, and other reparse points component by component from the volume/UNC anchor.
- Config reads/writes neither check nor automatically tighten permissions: POSIX saves keep the existing file mode and new files and directories follow the umask; on Windows new files and directories inherit the parent directory's ACL.
- Other private objects managed by `internal/fs` get a protected DACL exclusive to the current user at the moment of creation; never publish with an inherited ACL first and tighten later.
- Blocking exclusive locks use `LockFileEx`; the POSIX counterpart is `flock`.
- Atomic replacement in `internal/fs` is relative to a pinned parent handle; any secure-backend failure errors out explicitly and never silently falls back to plain path APIs.

## Released Rules

- `rules/en/KANDER-AGENTS.md` is the released rules entry; it first reads `kander config --json` for the current scope. `KANDER-BASE-RULES.md` and `KANDER-KANBAN-RULES.md` are the tool protocol; the other seven module booklets load per switch and per need, with the English originals in `rules/en/` and the Chinese translation in `rules/cn/`. No customized rule files are generated, and disabled modules are not loaded through cross references.
- The root `AGENTS.md` only constrains development of this repository; when changing the released workflow, change `rules/`. Do not write implementation details into the released booklets, and do not put the package map into `KANDER-AGENTS.md`.
- The runtime-created `kanban/` is machine-local shared data; never commit it and never write it into the project `.gitignore`.
